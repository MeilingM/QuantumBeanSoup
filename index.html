<h1>Quantum Bean Soup</h1>
  <div id="introbar"><p>Welcome! This is a blog website about the varying tensile strengths of 43 various types of Quantum Bean Soup. You'll find
    other stuff here as well, such as viola jokes and Sherlock-related everything. And other stuff too, we just haven't 
    decided what to put on here yet.</p></div>
  <h2>About us</h2>
  <p>We're not actually going to write anything on here about ourselves for reasons that can be found hidden deep
    inside your brain somewhere, but if you are a stalker know that we live somewhere in this universe. Cool beans. </p>
