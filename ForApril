Hi April!!!!
This is a brief set of instructions for how to add stuff on the website. I'll create the pages and style them, all you need to do is fill 
them in with random stuff about violas and Sherlock. And bean soup.

As I mentioned last Thursday, every command in html is called a tag. Tags start with the < symbol and end with a >. Every tag
has an end tag. The end is represented by a backslash (/). With the exception of the break <br> tag (which puts a little break in between
paragraphs and pictures), every single tag MUST BE ENDED. That is important. 

For example, the html (Hypertext Markup Language) document starts with an html tag: <html>. But when you finish writing the page, you need
to establish that the page is done, by ending it </html>

The same goes for all sorts of tags: title, head, body,paragraphs, etc etc. And after you get the basics down you can play with more fun
stuff, like text colors, pictures, links, buttons, text boxes, blah blah blah. So down below I will start with a couple of the most
frequently usefully used tags and an example. Text me before Monday AM if you need any help.

1. Font color
This tag lets you change the color of the text. Most browsers recognize basic color names, so you can type in 'red', 'blue', 'green',
and all that. But if you want more fun colors, search up 'html color picker' and a colorful box will pop up. You can select 
the shade and the intensity, copy the hex value (it's a six-digit/letter combination that looks something like this: #ff55ff. That
code there will produce a magenta color.)

Example:
<font color="ff55ff">Hi April. The text I'm typing will turn out magenta. But you don't want the entire thing to be magenta, so you end 
it like this. </font>

2. Bold, Italic, Strikethrough and Underline
These four tags are fairly straightforward. You type in the tag, type text in between and end the tag. Like so:

This text is <b>BOLD</b>
This text is <u>UNDERLINED</u>
This text is <i>ITALISIZED</i>
This text is <s>UNWANTED</s>
Pardon my spelling, this has no <font color="red">autocorrect.</font>

3. Headings
I went over this on Friday. The headings tag is very straightforward. There are six headings, labeled 1 to 6. 1 is the largest and 6
is the smallest.

<h1>Big text</h1>
<h2>Not-as-big text</h2>
<h3>Smaller text</h3>
<h4>Even smaller text</h4>
<h5>Small text</h5>
<h6>Smallest text</h6>
<h7>No just kidding, there is no h7 :) </h7>

4. Images
Ah yes. Images. I love images. Without them there would be no Tumblr and therefore no Shumblr (Sherlock fandom on Tumblr).
The image tag can be a bit confusing at times. There are many parameters, but for our purposes there are only three main ones that
you should concern yourself with.

<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/75/5b/2e/755b2e9d8976e50a047d2f5cc8d49fc0.jpg" width="100" height="100">
In this tag, there are three parts: the source, the width and the height.
The source specifies the image itself. I pulled this one off Google Images cause I was too lazy to upload it here, but ideally
you fist save the image to your camera roll/computer (if you're using a desktop) and upload it into this repository. When you upload
it you can rename the file to something simple, like viola.png for a picture of a viola. 
The width and height are simple. You type the amount in pixels in. MAKE SURE TO USE QUOTES. It will not work if you don't.

So if I wanted a picture of a viola that was named viola.png to be 50 by 50 pixels, I'd type this:
<img src="viola.png" width="50" height="50">
P.S. Copy the first image source in the first image tag into your search engine, see what pops up ;)

5. Lists
There are two types of lists: unnumbered <ul> and ordered <ol>. Unnumbered lists have bullet points, and ordered lists have numbers. That's the
only difference. Other than that, they are used the same way. Regardless of which list you use, they are all accompanied by the list item
<li> tag. It's kind of hard to explain, I'll put an example here and on the home webpage and try to define it.

Unnumbered list:
<ul>
<li>Cheese</li>
<li>Eggs</li>
<li>Ham</li>
<li>Mycroft</li>
</ul>

So, the <ul> tag tells the browser that an unnumbered list is coming up. The <li> tag specifies the actual items in the list.
So using this example, the webpage would display a bulleted list containing Cheese, Eggs, Ham and Mycroft. Let's look at another one.

Ordered list:
<ol>
<li>Broccoli</li>
<li>Carrots</li>
<li>Potatoes</li>
<li>Sherlock</li>
</ol>

This time instead of bullets, the site will show you a numbered list containing Broccoli, Carrots, Potatoes and Sherlock.

Make sense so far?
Here, have a meme. You earned it.

6. Paragraphs
This is super easy. Whenever you type a paragraph of text, you should start <p> and end it </p> with this tag. Not only does it
provide automatic spacing for your paragraphs, it also makes it super easy to style it using CSS - Cascading Style Sheet. (more on that
later! I'll take care of it for now.) Here's an excerpt from FANDOM (if you click ctrl-u on a webpage it will show you the source code):

<h1>Speedy's Cafe</h1>
<p>Speedy's Cafe is a small sandwich bar and cafe which is situated in Baker Street just to the right of the door to 221B and 221C.
The place is owned by Mr Chatterjee.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The caf√© serves as a convenient meeting place on at least one occasion; Mycroft Holmes sat here with John Watson to discuss 
Irene Adler, and how they would explain her death to Sherlock.</p>

<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>In the unaired pilot episode the shop was called "Mrs Hudson's Snax n' Sarnies" (Sarny being a British English variant of 'sandwich').</p>

<p>In reality, Speedy's Cafe, alongside the whole set of Baker Street for the series is filmed in North Gower Street, in Bloomsbury, 
Central London near Euston Road and Euston Railway station. The location of the set is approximately one mile away from the real 
Baker Street in Marylebone.</p>

7. Links
Last but not least, LINKS!!!! Not sausage links, digital links. Though I wish we could download sausage links from the web.
Links are one of the most important items you can have on a website. They string your pages together, can be used to redirect to
other sites, and also used to contact the owner, or anyone else's email for that matter. They are ridiculously simple to use, which
is why they are one of my favorite tags. They don't have to be applied to text either. You can put them on just about anything:
images, buttons, table cells or whatever shows up on a website.

<a href="http://www.mit.edu/~jcb/jokes/viola2.html">Viola Jokes by MIT</a>
<a href="http://www.mit.edu/~jcb/jokes/viola2.html"><img src="viola.png" width="221" height="221"></a>

Whenever you click on the viola picture or the text "Viola Jokes by MIT" it will take you to the page.

That's it for now. Thanks for reading, see you next week.
